Substitution Variable:
	The substitution variable is placeholder in an sql script where you want to substituye some values at runtime.
	The & character is used before substitution variable in query.
	
	SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name FROM employee
	WHERE department_id = &department_no;
	
	for string and date
	SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name FROM employee
	WHERE first_name = '&name';

	When we execute query it will ask to enter value.
	
	Substitution variable is not feature of sql script ,It is feature of sql tool.

	We can use more than one substitution variable in single query
	SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, &column_name FROM &table_name
	WHERE &condition ORDER BY &order_by

Double Ampersand (&&) Define and Undefine command:
	SELECT employee_id, first_name,last_name FROM employee 
	WHERE salary BETWEEN &sal AND &sal + 1000;

	sql developer ask for sal value for 2 times.

	SELECT employee_id, first_name,last_name FROM employee 
	WHERE salary BETWEEN &&sal AND &sal + 1000;
	
	By using && it will ask only once for sal value.
	Value of sal is get store for session.

	Define command is use to define value for the substitution variable.
	Define command is same as &&.
	It is store in memory for session.

	DEFINE emp_no = 100;
	SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employee_id =&emp_no;

	To change the value of substitution variable you just need to change value from define command
	DEFINE emp_no = 200;

	To see all substitution variable:
	DEFINE;
	To check specific variable:
	DEFINE emp_no;

	To delete/remove variable from memory you have to use UNDEFINE command
	UNDEFINE emp_no;

	You can use DEF and UNDEF instead of DEFINE and UNDEFINE.

ACCEPT and PROMPT
	ACCEPT take input from user and store it in user variable.
	PROMPT command is used to display a message to the user for supplying a brief explaination of what your script is going to accomplish.

	ACCEPT emp_id PROMPT 'Enter valid employee id:';
	SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employee_id = &emp_id;

	ACCEPT min_sal PROMPT 'Enter minimum salary:';
	ACCEPT max_sal PROMPT 'Enter maximum salary:';	
	SELECT * FROM employee WHERE salary BETWEEN &min_sal and &max_sal;

SET VERIFY ON/OFF:
	VERIFY command displays the status of the variable before and after the substitution.
	It can use in 2 ways:	
	SET VERIFY ON;	To turn on verification
	SET VERIFY OFF;	To turn off verification

	SET VERIFY ON;
	SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name FROM employees
	WHERE employee_id = &emp_id;

	
	SET VERIFY OFF;
	SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name FROM employees
	WHERE employee_id = &emp_id;

SET DEFINE OFF:
	If in employee table there is department called R&D and you want to get its employee

	SELECT * FROM employee WHERE department_name = 'R&D';

	Above command will ask for value as it take &D as substitution variable
	In this case you can use SET DEFINE OFF command
	It will turn off substitution variable for session

	SET DEFINE OFF;
	SELECT * FROM employee WHERE employee_id = 'R&D';
