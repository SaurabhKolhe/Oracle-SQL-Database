Changes the returning rows order by any column or alias or numeric positions of the column in SELECT list.

Can sort the retrieved row in ASC or DESC order.
if we not specify anything for type order, the default order is ascending.

SELECT column1,column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition ORDER BY column_name;

Example:
	SELECT first_name,last_name,salary FROM employee ORDER BY first_name;
	
Order by can sort with multiple column
	SELECT first_name,last_name,salary FROM employee ORDER BY first_name,last_name;

Order by clause can use with column position in SELECT list or column order in database
	SELECT * FROM employee ORDER BY 1;
	SELECT * FROM employee ORDER BY 5;

ASC and DESC:
	By default order by is in ASC.
	
	Sort by Descending order
	SELECT first_name,last_name,salary FROM employee ORDER BY first_name desc;
	
	SELECT first_name,last_name,salary FROM employee ORDER BY first_name,last_name desc;

	Aliases and numeric position of column can use with asc and desc
	SELECT first_name,last_name,salary s FROM employee ORDER BY first_name desc,3 desc,s ;
	
NULL value sorting (NULLS FIRST and NULLS LAST):
	Commision column having some null values
	SELECT first_name,last_name,salary,commision FROM employee ORDER BY commision ;
	
	SELECT first_name,last_name,salary,commision FROM employee ORDER BY commision NULLS FIRST;

	SELECT first_name,last_name,salary,commision FROM employee ORDER BY commision NULLS LAST;

ROWID and ROWNUM:

	ROWID				ROWNUM

 The ROWID is a unique identifier      The ROWNUM is nothing but the
 that contain the physical address     consecutive logical sequence no
 of row.			       given to the row fetch from table
 autimatically generate ROWID

 ROWID is Permanant and doesn't	       ROWNUM is temparary
 change

 Fastest way to access single row is
 using its ROWID


FETCH Clause:
The FETCH clause is used in conjunction with the SELECT and ORDER BY clauses to limit the rows and retrive a portion of returning rows.

[OFFSET row_to_skip ROW[S]] FETCH [FIRST][NEXT] [row_count | percent PERCENT] ROW[S] [ONLY | WITH TIES];
OFFSET = exclude no of rows from top
FETCH  = retreive no of  rows
only = retreive exact no of rows
TIES WITH = retrive exact no of rows with rows with same as last row result.
	    have to use ORDER BY to use WITH TIES

	SELECT first_name,last_name,salary FROM employee ORDER BY salary DESC
	OFFSET 1 ROW FETCH FIRST 10 ROWS ONLY;
	Here it will retrieve exact 10 rows.

	SELECT first_name,last_name,salary FROM employee ORDER BY salary DESC
	OFFSET 1 ROW FETCH 10 ROWS WITH TIES;
	Here it will return 10 rows and if salary of other row is same as 10 then it will return that also
