Where clause:
	SELECT * FROM employee WHERE employee_id = 101;

	WHERE CLAUSE help to give exact output.
	We can use Arithmetic,LIKE,BETWEEN,AND,IN,IS NULL,Logical operator with WHERE CLAUSE to get exact output.

Using Comparison Operators:
	SELECT * FROM employee WHERE salary > 10000;
	SELECT * FROM employee WHERE salary = 1000 * 20;
	SELECT employee_id FROM employee WHERE employee_id < 200;
	SELECT * FROM employee WHERE manager_id != 100;
	<> This is also not equal to sign.

Using BETWEEN ... AND operator:
	lower and upper limit are included.

	SELECT * FROM employee WHERE salary BETWEEN 10000 AND 14000;
	SELECT * FROM employee WHERE hire_date BETWEEN '07-JUN-02' AND '29-JAN-05';
		
Using IN Operator:
	order of specified value is not important.
	It will search for exact match

	SELECT * FROM employee WHERE employee_id IN (50,100,65,210);
	SELECT * FROM employee WHERE first _name IN ('Steven','Peter','Adam');
	SELECT * FROM employee WHERE hire_date IN ('03-JAN-02','30-JUL-05');
	
Using LIKE operator:
	used for searching some text in string values.
	It is case sensative.
	wildcard perform search and retrive row matching a certain character pattern.	

	%	Matches any number of characters including 0 or more character
	_	Matches exactly one character

	SELECT * FROM employee WHERE last_name LIKE A%;
	SELECT * FROM employee WHERE first_name LIKE STE%;
	SELECT * FROM employee WHERE first_name LIKE STE_VE;
	SELECT * FROM employee WHERE first_name LIKE _T%;

Using IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operator:
	Used for searching NULL value.
	
	SELECT * FROM employee WHERE last_name IS NULL;

	SELECT * FROM employee WHERE last_name IS NOT NULL;

Using LOGICAL operator:
	AND: all condition must be true.
	SELECT * FROM employee WHERE job_id = 'SA_REP' AND 
		salary > 10000 AND first_name = 'Lisa';
 
	OR: any one condition must be true.
	SELECT * FROM employee WHERE job_id = 'SA_REP' OR
		salary > 10000 ;
	
	NOT: Use to negate the condition
	SELECT * FROM employee WHERE salary > 10000 AND job_id NOT IN ('SA_MAN', 'SA_REP');

RULES OF PRECEDENCE:
	order	Meaning
	1	Arthimetic operators
	2	Concatenation operator
	3	Comparison condition
	4	IS [NOT] NULL,LIKE,[NOT] IN
	5	[NOT] BOOLEEAN
	6	Not Equal to
	7	NOT logical operator
	8	AND logical operator
	9	OR Logical operator

	You can use parenthesis () for change preference
	SELECT * FROM employeee WHERE (job_id = 'ST_CLERK' OR 
	job_id = 'IT_PROG') AND salary > 5000; 
	Here bydefault AND operator executed first but using () we change order of preference.
